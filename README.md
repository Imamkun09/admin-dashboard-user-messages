# Admin Dashboard - User Messages

## Project Overview
The **Admin Dashboard - User Messages** is a web-based application designed to help administrators manage and view messages sent by users. The application provides an interface for displaying user messages, allowing administrators to filter and search through messages efficiently. The dashboard features several statistics such as total users, messages for the day, and average response time.

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have a web server to serve HTML files. You can use tools like [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) for development.
2. Download or clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Open the `code.html` file in your browser or use a local server.

## Usage
1. After loading the dashboard, you will see a summary of user messages with statistics at the top.
2. Utilize the search bar to filter messages by user input.
3. Click the "View" button next to each message to see the complete text.
4. Use the "Delete" button if you want to remove any message (functionality for deletion would need to be implemented).
5. Navigate through the pagination controls at the bottom to view more messages.

## Features
- Fully responsive design for desktop and mobile views.
- Search functionality to filter messages in real-time.
- Display statistics about users and messages.
